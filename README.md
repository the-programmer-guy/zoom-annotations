# Virtual-Annotation
This will be a service that would provide the feature of a Virtual camera to be chosen while on Live Stream. The features include live annotations of comic or text annotations on the video as per your expression. This is currently being developed using python for machine learning purpose and java script has been used to implement the web browser virtual camera service.

# Setting Up
Use the URL : https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/iAr6pG2B6/ (This is the location where the python database for the code has been uploaded. Download the model and use it with the code.

Replace the URL with your customized model for recognition. Here we use Tensoflow JS for execution.

After the model has been connected. Make sure to change the labels such as in this code the labels question, yes, no, enjoy has been used.

You can add your own labels and gesture recognition.

After the code has been integrated with the model, run the code.

You would see a video stream playing in the browser.

Use OBS-Virtual-Camera to use the browser as a camera input.

Now open up Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams or any other conferencing app and use your own gestures to stand out of the crowd and present your views boldly with live annotations.


Voila!

# Main Aim of further Development

The main aim of the project is to convert the entire steps ahead in a single double click .exe
The .exe has to be tapped and it has its own virtual camera feedback that can be used as an input in conferencing app.
